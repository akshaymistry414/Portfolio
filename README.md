# My Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio.
I am a Chemical Engineering (MEng) graduate with almost four years experience in the defence and chemicals sector. I have worked with data throughout my career, and appreciate how powerful of a tool data can be when trying to solve complex problems. Because of this, I am excited to showcase my work as I transition to the next stage of my career as a data analyst.
